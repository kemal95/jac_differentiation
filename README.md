# JAC
**JAC(obian)** is a simple Machine Learning Library written from scratch in Julia. It is built on top of an Automatic Differentiation Engine called **BrezDiff** (homage to Claude Brezinski). The purpose of this repository is to document every single step on the way to build a simple Machine Learning Library. Most Machine Learning from scratch tutorials start by manually implementing chain rule. That's not happening here! I'll start with an Automatic Differentiation Engine and then build Machine Learning library around that. 

## Repository Structure
- If you're looking to learn about how I built this library, read through everything in the folder [nb](https://github.com/tgautam03/jac/tree/master/nb). It contains several jupyter notebooks explaining every single step in detail. I would recommend starting from the very first folder as I'll build up the code repo step by step.
